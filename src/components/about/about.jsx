          Hello! My name is Suraj and I enjoy creating things that live on the
          internet.
        </p>
        <p className="a-desc">
          My interest in web development started back last year when I was
          trying to edit things on the web â€” taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!.
          Fast Forwarding to today, I built a number of web applications and 4
          major projects. Learned a great deal about teamwork, leadership, and
          communication. After months of rigorous training, here I am looking
          for an opportunity as a full stack web developer.

              So far, I have learned JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MongoDB,
              Node.JS, and Express.JS. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet
              more problems to solve, and yet this more to build.
